PROJECT TITLE â€“ MACHINE LEARNING MODEL DEVELOPMENT FOR A SOFT 
PNEUMATIC DRIVEN ROBOT

This project focuses on the development of a reduced order machine learning model for a soft pneumatic-driven robotic hand capable of performing complex axial bending and twisting movements. The primary objective is to design a control model leveraging soft pneumatic actuators to achieve precise and adaptive movements in the robotic hand. The machine learning model was trained on a dataset generated from a finite element model simulating these movements, with further validation against experimental data.

The trained model demonstrated over 90% accuracy on the validation set, showcasing its efficacy in controlling the desired movements of the robotic hand. This high level of precision indicates the model's potential for significant contributions to the field of soft robotics. The methodology encompassed selecting suitable machine learning algorithms, dataset creation and preprocessing, model training and validation.

Despite the challenge of limited training data, the project successfully employed data augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset. The results underline the potential applications of soft pneumatic robots in various domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, and rehabilitation. practical testing on the robotic hand need to be followed and Future work could expand the model's capabilities by incorporating additional movements or exploring alternative control methods, setting a foundation for advanced research and development in soft pneumatic robotics.
